## Running the project

### System Requirements

You need to have python and pip installed.

### Running on Replit

Change the URL in `index.html` to be the URL your Replit repo supplies.

Run through the shell, so it tells you what dependencies you're missing.

### Running through the terminal

Instructions can be found here for running on a Mac: https://topherpedersen.blog/2019/12/28/how-to-setup-a-new-flask-app-on-a-mac/

### Installing Dependencies

The following dependencies need to be installed:

* Flask `pip3 install Flask`
*
